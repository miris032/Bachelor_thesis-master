Running the dataset.py file results in a dataset that is stored in a folder 'ticker_data', which includes 3 folders (minutely, hourly, daily)
with csv files for each ticker symbol. Each of these folders includes a plots folder with all ticker
open, high, low and close data being plotted seperately and a folder with candlestick charts per ticker
for ohlc data.
